There may be cases where users want to search for Contacts that contain these specific fields. As such, the Whispir API supports searching for contacts using these custom fields.  Any custom field can be searched by adding the custom_ prepended to the name.  For example, if the field name is **StaffId**, then the URL would search for:  `/contacts?custom_StaffId=12345`
